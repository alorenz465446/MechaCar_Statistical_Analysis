# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis

## Overview

AutosRUs’ newest prototype, the MechaCar, is suffering from production troubles that are blocking the manufacturing team’s progress

review the production data for insights that may help the manufacturing team.

In this challenge, you’ll help Jeremy and the data analytics team do the following:

Perform multiple linear regression analysis to identify which variables in the dataset predict the mpg of MechaCar prototypes

Q: Which variable coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?

Each Pr value in the table above is seen as the probabilty each coefficient gives a random amount of varience to the linnear model. 

A: Using the MechaCar_mpg dataset, vehicle_length and ground clearance are statistically significant. This means vehicle_length and ground_clearance have an impact on mpg.


Collect summary statistics on the pounds per square inch (PSI) of the suspension coils from the manufacturing lots
Run t-tests to determine if the manufacturing lots are statistically different from the mean population


Design a statistical study to compare vehicle performance of the MechaCar vehicles against vehicles from other manufacturers. For each statistical analysis, you’ll write a summary interpretation of the findings.
